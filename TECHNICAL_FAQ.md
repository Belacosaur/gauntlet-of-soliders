# Gauntlet of SOLiders - Technical FAQ

## Blockchain & Smart Contracts

### Q: Why did you choose Solana for Gauntlet of SOLiders?

**A:** Solana provides several critical advantages for our game:
- **Speed & Cost**: Sub-second finality and transactions costing fractions of a cent
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling 65,000+ TPS to support many concurrent battles
- **Ecosystem**: Thriving gaming and NFT community with established marketplaces like Magic Eden
- **Developer Tools**: Rich SDKs and libraries for rapid development
- **NFT Standards**: Reliable Solana NFT standards with Magic Eden marketplace integration
- **Energy Efficiency**: Environmentally-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism

### Q: How do you ensure NFT ownership and proper integration with the game?

**A:** We use Solana's Token Metadata standard for our NFTs, which provides:
- Verifiable on-chain ownership
- Permanent storage of asset metadata
- Attribute verification for gameplay mechanics
- Seamless integration with popular Solana wallets
- Compatibility with Magic Eden and other Solana marketplaces

Each NFT contains both visual traits and gameplay attributes that are read directly from the blockchain during battles.

### Q: What smart contracts power the game, and how are they architected?

**A:** Our game uses three primary smart contract modules:
1. **NFT Integration**: Allows verification and reading of NFT attributes
2. **Battle System**: Handles game mechanics, move verification, and outcome determination 
3. **Tournament/Treasury**: Manages entry fees, prizes, and reward distribution

The architecture follows a modular design pattern that separates concerns while allowing secure interaction between components. This provides:
- Easier auditability
- Targeted upgradeability
- Clear security boundaries
- Efficient gas consumption

### Q: How do you ensure smart contract security?

**A:** We implement multiple layers of security:
1. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of critical contract functions
2. **Multiple Audits**: Third-party code reviews by respected security firms
3. **Timelocks**: Delay periods for sensitive admin functions
4. **Bug Bounty**: Public incentives for responsible disclosure
5. **Progressive Rollout**: Phased deployment starting with lower-stakes functionality

Additionally, our battle system uses a commit-reveal pattern to prevent move sniping and front-running attacks.

### Q: How decentralized is the game?

**A:** The game employs a hybrid approach:
- **On-Chain**: NFT ownership, game rules, battle outcomes, tournament results, and rewards
- **Off-Chain**: Game client, matchmaking, UI rendering, and non-critical data storage

This hybrid design optimizes for both decentralization of critical components and practical gameplay performance. Players maintain full ownership of their NFTs and earned rewards regardless of the game service availability.

## Game Mechanics

### Q: How does the battle system work?

**A:** The game features a strategic Rock/Paper/Scissors system with added depth:
1. **3x3 Grid**: Each player controls their side of a battlefield grid
2. **Positioning**: Character placement affects attack and defense capabilities
3. **Class Abilities**: Each character class has unique special abilities
4. **Move Selection**: Players choose Rock/Paper/Scissors plus grid position
5. **Result Calculation**: Outcomes consider move type, position, and character stats
6. **Damage Application**: HP reduction based on move outcome and character stats
7. **Battle Resolution**: First player to reduce opponent's HP to zero wins

The system creates a perfect balance between skill-based strategy and accessible gameplay mechanics.

### Q: How do NFT traits affect gameplay?

**A:** Each NFT has several traits that directly impact gameplay:
- **Class**: Determines base stats and special abilities
- **Weapon**: Affects attack type and special effects
- **Armor**: Provides defense bonuses against specific attack types
- **Helmet**: Modifies special ability parameters
- **Rarity**: Provides overall stat multipliers
- **Special Effects**: Grants unique conditional bonuses

These traits create thousands of strategic combinations without making rare NFTs insurmountably powerful. Even common NFTs can defeat legendary ones with the right strategy and moves.

### Q: How do you prevent cheating in battles?

**A:** Our anti-cheat system has multiple components:
1. **Commit-Reveal Pattern**: Players submit encrypted moves that are revealed only after both players have committed
2. **Server Validation**: A validator node confirms move legality and outcome calculation
3. **Smart Contract Verification**: On-chain verification of battle results
4. **Replay Protection**: Prevention of move resubmission or reuse
5. **Timeout Handling**: Fair resolution of abandoned matches
6. **Deterministic Outcomes**: No RNG-based results that could be manipulated

These measures ensure fair play while maintaining the competitive integrity of tournaments.

### Q: How are tournaments structured?

**A:** Tournaments follow a flexible structure:
- **Entry**: Open or invite-only with optional entry fees
- **Format**: Single elimination, double elimination, or round-robin
- **Matchmaking**: Skill-based or random pairing
- **Rewards**: SOL prizes distributed automatically via smart contract
- **Seasons**: Regular tournament seasons with cumulative rankings
- **Special Events**: Themed tournaments with unique rules and prizes

All tournament results and prize distributions are recorded on-chain for complete transparency.
