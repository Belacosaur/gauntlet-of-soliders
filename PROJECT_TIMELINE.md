   - Smart contracts must be fully developed before security audit
   - Security audit must be completed before mainnet deployment

2. **Art Assets → Frontend Implementation → Testing**
   - Character designs needed before frontend NFT viewer implementation
   - UI components needed before related frontend features

3. **Backend Services → Integration → End-to-End Testing**
   - Core backend services required before integration with frontend
   - Full integration needed before comprehensive testing

## Risk Management Timeline Considerations

### Potential Delay Factors

1. **Smart Contract Complexity** (1-2 month potential impact)
   - Risk window: Months 3-6
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping, incremental development

2. **Security Audit Findings** (2-4 week potential impact)
   - Risk window: Month 8
   - Mitigation: Early internal security review, secure coding practices

3. **Art Production Delays** (2-4 week potential impact)
   - Risk window: Months 1-3
   - Mitigation: Clear art direction, early concept approval

4. **Integration Challenges** (2-4 week potential impact)
   - Risk window: Months 5-6
   - Mitigation: Frequent integration testing, clear API contracts
