## NFT Generation Pipeline

### Technical Implementation
1. **Asset Preparation**:
   - Creation of all individual trait components
   - Organized in layers for procedural combination
   - Consistent naming convention for automated processing

2. **Generation Algorithm**:
   - Custom trait combination system respecting rarity tiers
   - Collision detection to prevent incompatible trait combinations
   - Hash-based generation to ensure verifiable randomness
   - Metadata structure validation

3. **Output Processing**:
   - Automated sprite composition and rendering
   - Metadata generation in Solana-compatible format
   - Preview image generation for Magic Eden display
   - Full resolution asset creation for in-game use

4. **Quality Control**:
   - Automated visual validation of all generated NFTs
   - Trait distribution analysis
   - Rarity verification
   - Metadata integrity checks

### NFT Minting Process via Magic Eden
- Magic Eden Launchpad setup and configuration
- Phased minting approach (whitelist â†’ public)
- Reveal mechanism (immediate or delayed based on final decision)
- Secondary market metadata and image hosting
- Royalty configuration (5-10% standard on Magic Eden)
